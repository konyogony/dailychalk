Let me re-calculate with \\(g=9.81\\) just to see. \\\\If \\(g=9.81\\): \\\\ \\(KE_i = \\frac{1}{2}(2)(5^2) = 25 \\text{ J}\\). \\\\ \\(W_g = mgh = 2(9.81)(0.5d) = 9.81d \\text{ J}\\). \\\\ \\(R = mg\\cos(30^\\circ) = 2(9.81)(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = 9.81\\sqrt{3} \\text{ N}\\). \\\\ \\(F_f = \\mu R = 0.2(9.81\\sqrt{3}) = 1.962\\sqrt{3} \\text{ N}\\). \\\\ \\(W_f = F_f d = 1.962\\sqrt{3}d \\text{ J}\\). \\\\ \\(25 = 9.81d + 1.962\\sqrt{3}d = d(9.81 + 1.962\\sqrt{3})\\). \\\\ \\(d = \\frac{25}{9.81 + 1.962(1.732)} = \\frac{25}{9.81 + 3.398} = \\frac{25}{13.208} \\approx 1.893\\). \\\\Still not \\(1.35\\). Let's assume my calculation with \\(g=10\\) is correct and update the possible answers. It's important to be consistent with the given value of \\(g\\). \\\\So, \\(d = \\frac{25}{10 + 2\\sqrt{3}} \\text{ m}\\). \\\\Numerically, \\(d \\approx 1.8568 \\text{ m}\\).",
