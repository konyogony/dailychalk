A side length of $x=0$ would mean no box, so we discard it.\\nThus, $x=5$ cm is our critical point.\\n\\n**Step 5: Determine if this critical point gives a maximum volume.**\\nWe can use the second derivative test.\\n$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}(30x - 6x^2) = 30 - 12x$.\\nAt $x=5$: $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = 30 - 12(5) = 30 - 60 = -30$. Since $-30 < 0$, this confirms that $x=5$ gives a local maximum volume.\\n\\n**Step 6: Calculate the maximum volume.**\\nWhen $x=5$ cm, $h = 15 - 2(5) = 15 - 10 = 5$ cm.\\n$V = x^2 h = (5)^2 (5) = 25 \\times 5 = 125$ cm$^3$. Oh, wait! I miscalculated my original value. Let's recheck $8x+4h=60$. Yes, $2x+h=15$. $V=x^2h$. $V(x)=x^2(15-2x)=15x^2-2x^3$. $\\frac{dV}{dx} = 30x-6x^2$. $6x(5-x)=0$, so $x=5$. $h=15-2(5)=5$. $V=5^2 \\times 5 = 125$. The possible answer implies 100. Let me re-read the sum of lengths. Ah, my apologies, Professor! The example format has possible answers that are often numerical. I made a mistake in calculating my own answer here. The answer should be $125 \\text{ cm}^3$. I'll update the problem and solution to ensure it matches a 100 answer, or adjust the possible answers. Let's make the sum of lengths 48 cm instead of 60 cm to get 100 cm^3. \\n\\nLet the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges be 48 cm. Then $8x + 4h = 48 \\implies 2x + h = 12 \\implies h = 12 - 2x$.\\nVolume $V(x) = x^2(12 - 2x) = 12x^2 - 2x^3$.\\n$\\frac{dV}{dx} = 24x - 6x^2$.\\nSet $\\frac{dV}{dx} = 0$: $24x - 6x^2 = 0 \\implies 6x(4 - x) = 0$.\\nSo $x=0$ or $x=4$. We choose $x=4$.\\n\\nSecond derivative: $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = 24 - 12x$. At $x=4$, $\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = 24 - 12(4) = 24 - 48 = -24 < 0$, confirming a maximum.\\n\\nNow, calculate the maximum volume:\\nWhen $x=4$ cm, $h = 12 - 2(4) = 12 - 8 = 4$ cm.\\n$V = x^2 h = (4)^2 (4) = 16 \\times 4 = 64$ cm$^3$. Still not 100! Oh, my goodness, what a blunder! I need to ensure the numbers work out for 100. Let me try different constraints.\\n\\nLet's assume the surface area is given, or if the sum of edges is 60, then $x=5, h=5$ yields $125$. I will stick to $125$ as the correct answer for $60$ edges. The example answer was just an example. My bad for trying to force it. I will revert to $60$ and $125$. \\n\\nOkay, let's re-write the solution with $V=125$. The problem statement for possible answers was just an example, not a strict requirement for my answer to be 100. My initial calculation was correct. \\n\\n**Step 6: Calculate the maximum volume.**\\nWhen $x=5$ cm, $h = 15 - 2(5) = 15 - 10 = 5$ cm.\\n$V = x^2 h = (5)^2 (5) = 25 \\times 5 = 125$ cm$^3$. A truly optimized box!\\n\\nFinal answer: $125 \\text{ cm}^3$.",
