This suggests that $(x-2)$ is a factor of $f(x)$. A simple function with a vertex at $(2,0)$ is a quadratic function of the form $f(x) = k(x-2)^2$.\nWhen $y = |f(x)|$, all y-values are non-negative. If $f(x)$ is always non-negative, then $y = |f(x)|$ is identical to $y = f(x)$.\nLet's assume $f(x) = k(x-2)^2$. Since the graph $y=|f(x)|$ passes through $(0,4)$, we have:\n$4 = |k(0-2)^2|$\n$4 = |k(-2)^2|$\n$4 = |4k|$.\nThis means $4k = 4$ or $4k = -4$. So $k=1$ or $k=-1$.\nIf $k=1$, then $f(x) = (x-2)^2$. In this case, $f(x)$ is always non-negative, so $|f(x)| = f(x)$. The graph of $y=(x-2)^2$ has a vertex at $(2,0)$ and opens upwards, passing through $(0, (0-2)^2=4)$. This matches the given information for $y=|f(x)|$.\nIf $k=-1$, then $f(x) = -(x-2)^2$. In this case, $f(x)$ is always non-positive. The graph of $y=-(x-2)^2$ has a vertex at $(2,0)$ and opens downwards. Then $y=|f(x)| = |-(x-2)^2| = (x-2)^2$, which also matches the given graph.\nHowever, the question asks for 'a possible equation for $f(x)$' and to 'sketch the graph of $y=f(x)$'. If $f(x)=-(x-2)^2$, the sketch would be an inverted parabola. If $f(x)=(x-2)^2$, the sketch would be a normal parabola.\nGiven the context of 'vertex at (2,0) and passes through (0,4)' often implies an upward opening parabola for $y=x^2$, the simplest assumption for $f(x)$ is usually the one that is directly observed unless otherwise specified.\nSo, a possible equation for $f(x)$ is $f(x) = (x-2)^2$. For this function, $f(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x$, so the graph of $y=f(x)$ is identical to the graph of $y=|f(x)|$.

The only horizontal force acting on A is the tension $T$ pulling it to the right (assuming the pulley is to the right).\nApplying Newton's Second Law ($F=ma$) in the horizontal direction:\n$T = m_A a$\n$T = 3a$ (Equation 1)\n\nFor Particle B (mass $m_B = 2\\text{ kg}$):\nParticle B is hanging freely. The forces acting on B are the tension $T$ upwards and its weight $m_B g$ downwards. Since the system will accelerate, B will move downwards.\nApplying Newton's Second Law ($F=ma$) in the vertical direction (taking downwards as positive):\n$m_B g - T = m_B a$\n$2(10) - T = 2a$\n$20 - T = 2a$ (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we have a system of two linear equations. Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n$20 - (3a) = 2a$\n$20 = 2a + 3a$\n$20 = 5a$\n$a = \\frac{20}{5}$\n$a = 4\\text{ m/s}^2$.\nThe acceleration of particle A (and B) is $4\\text{ m/s}^2$.",
