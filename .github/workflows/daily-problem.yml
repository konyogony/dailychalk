name: Generate Daily Math Problems

# This workflow runs daily at 6 AM UTC to generate new math problems
# Improvements made:
# - Increased API timeout from 30s to 90s for slow Gemini API responses
# - Simplified retry logic: 5 retries handled in the script with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, 30s)
# - Email notifications sent ONLY when generation fails after all retries
# - Removed redundant workflow-level retries for cleaner logs

                      The daily math problem generation workflow has failed after all retry attempts.

                      Workflow: ${{ github.workflow }}
                      Run: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

                      Please check the workflow logs for details:
                      ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}

                      The script attempted 5 retries with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, 30s).
                      This is likely an issue with the Gemini API being slow or unavailable.
